## 🚀 Implementation Details

### What Changed in Code:
1. **Removed:** Black solid background
2. **Added:** Responsive image switching based on screen size
   - Mobile (< 768px): Uses `hero-car-mobile.jpg`
   - Desktop (≥ 768px): Uses `hero-car-desktop.jpg`
3. **Adjusted:** Overlay opacity for better text readability
   - Mobile: `from-black/70` (lighter overlay)
   - Desktop: `from-black/80` (darker overlay)

### CSS Breakpoint Used:
- `md:hidden` = Hide mobile image on tablets/desktop (screen-width ≥ 768px)
- `hidden md:block` = Show desktop image on tablets/desktop

### Fallback Behavior:
If images fail to load, SVG placeholders automatically display with text

## 📋 Steps to Upload Real Images:
